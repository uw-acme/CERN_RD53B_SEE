CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-469] The REFCLK pin of IDELAYCTRL IDELAYCTRL_inst_REPLICATED_0 has a clock period of 1.563 ns (frequency 640.000 Mhz) but IDELAYE2 u_lane_original/xapp1017_serdes_1280.serdes_cmp/loop0[0].idelay_s has REFCLK_FREQUENCY of 310.000 Mhz (period 3.226 ns). The IDELAYCTRL REFCLK pin frequency must match the IDELAYE2 REFCLK_FREQUENCY property.
Resolution: Check that the IDELAYCTRL REFCLK pin is receiving a clock and that the period of the clock matches the REFCLK_FREQUENCY property of the <IDELAYE2/ODELAYE2>.
